![version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-ff5a8c)

**Prompt-first PCB CAD for Claude Code.** No schematic step: describe the board
in plain language and Claude Code drives a custom TypeScript engine over MCP —
picking real [LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/) parts, placing footprints, wiring
connectivity, autorouting with [Freerouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting),
running DRC, and exporting a
[JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/)-ready fab package (`gerbers.zip` + `bom.csv` +
`cpl.csv`). A live browser view shows the board update as it's built.



## Features

- **Prompt-first workflow over MCP** — 35 tools cover the whole flow: parts →
  placement → nets → routing → DRC → fab export. No schematic step.
- **Real parts** — LCSC keyword search plus EasyEDA footprint fetch/parse with
  real pad numbers and geometry, cached locally under `~/.flamingo/parts/`.
- **Live browser editor** — WebSocket-synced canvas view with selection and
  drag editing, a via tool (hover copper to inherit its net), silk text/line
  editing, board search, zone & label layer toggles, copper island tints, a
  nets panel showing each net's track width, a one-click **Lock & Route**
  button, and **Run DRC** with red canvas markers.
- **3D view + STEP export** — interactive 3D board with real vendor component
  models, 3D silkscreen, and STEP export in two flavours: light courtyard
  blocks or full detail (copper, silk, drilled barrels).
- **Autorouting** — Freerouting integration with per-net routing, automatic
  thin-escape retry for fat nets that can't exit fine-pitch pads, a widen pass
  that necks down only at obstructions, and automatic GND stitching vias for
  orphaned pour islands.
- **Copper features** — zone pours with filled-copper connectivity, keepouts,
  mounting holes/slots, and per-net-class track width / clearance / via rules.
- **DRC against JLCPCB capabilities** — rulesets picked by layer count:
  clearance, track width, drill/annular/via minimums, copper-to-edge,
  keepouts, hole-to-hole, courtyard overlap, silk-over-pad, unconnected nets,
  and outline checks.
- **Live stock check in DRC** — every placed part is checked against JLCPCB's
  assembly parts library; out-of-stock parts gate export (waivable), low or
  unknown stock is reported as a non-gating advisory.
- **Board-aware silkscreen** — refdes labels are auto-placed on-board,
  pad-safe, and non-overlapping by a whole-board solver.
- **Fab-ready export** — Gerber X2 + Excellon drills, JLCPCB BOM/CPL, a
  reference render SVG, and a browser download zip shaped for direct upload
  to JLCPCB's order page.
- **Op-log editing** — every change is an operation with full undo/redo;
  boards are plain JSON files that diff cleanly in git.
- **Agent-friendly feedback** — PNG screenshots (with ratsnest and DRC
  overlays), text board summaries, and connection listings on demand.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build

# Serve a board (creates board.flamingo if it doesn't exist):
node packages/server/dist/cli.js serve board.flamingo
#   … or, once the server package is linked, `npx flamingo serve board.flamingo`

# Open the live view:
open http://localhost:4242
```

Point Claude Code at the running server by dropping this `.mcp.json` in your
project (it's already at the repo root):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flamingo": { "type": "http", "url": "http://localhost:4242/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Now ask Claude Code to build a board — e.g. _"make me a 2-layer ESP32-S3
breakout with USB-C power and a 3.3V LDO"_ — and watch the browser view fill in.

## Requirements

- **Node.js 22+**
- **A Java runtime** (for the Freerouting autorouter). On macOS: `brew install
  openjdk` (keg-only — either add `/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin` to `PATH` or
  set `JAVA_HOME`). `freerouting.jar` is downloaded to `~/.flamingo/` on first
  autoroute.
- **Network** on first use, to fetch part footprints from the EasyEDA/LCSC API
  (cached under `~/.flamingo/parts/` afterward).

## The workflow

```
prompt → parts → place → connect → route → drc → export
```

1. **parts** — `parts_search` (keyword) then `parts_get` (pad list) to choose
   real LCSC parts and learn their pin numbers.
2. **place** — `new_board`, `set_board_outline`, then `place_component` /
   `move_component` to lay out footprints (mm, y-up).
3. **connect** — `connect_pins` builds nets from `REFDES.PAD` pin refs;
   `create_net_class` / `assign_net_class` set track/via/clearance rules.
4. **features** — `add_zone` (copper pours), `add_mounting_hole`, `add_silk_text`,
   `add_keepout`.
5. **route** — `autoroute` runs Freerouting for bulk routing; `add_track` /
   `add_via` place surgical fixes by hand; `get_ratsnest` / `unroute` help
   iterate.
6. **drc** — `run_drc` reports violations against the JLCPCB ruleset for the
   board's layer count, and checks live JLCPCB assembly stock for every placed
   part: a part with less stock than one board needs is a gating `stock-out`
   violation; low stock (fewer than 100 boards buildable) and parts missing
   from the JLC library are non-gating advisories. Set
   `FLAMINGO_STOCK_CHECK=off` to skip the stock half (e.g. offline).
   `run_erc` checks the circuit itself (see "Electrical checks" below).
7. **export** — `export_fab` runs DRC (fills zones first, including the stock
   check) and ERC, writes the JLCPCB fileset plus `checks.json` with every
   finding, and refuses on any DRC violation or ERC error unless `waiveDrc` is set.

`screenshot` renders the board to a PNG at any point so Claude can see what it's
doing.

## MCP tools

35 tools are served at `http://localhost:4242/mcp`:

| Group | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| **Board / project** | `new_board`, `open_board`, `save_board`, `get_board_state`, `describe_connections` |
| **Parts** | `parts_search`, `parts_get`, `datasheet_get` |
| **Placement** | `place_component`, `move_component`, `remove_component` |
| **Connectivity** | `connect_pins`, `disconnect_pins`, `create_net_class`, `assign_net_class` |
| **Board features** | `set_board_outline`, `add_zone`, `add_keepout`, `add_mounting_hole`, `add_silk_text`, `add_silk_line`, `remove_item` |
| **Routing / analysis** | `add_track`, `add_via`, `get_ratsnest`, `autoroute`, `unroute`, `widen_tracks`, `run_drc` |
| **Checks** | `run_erc` |
| **History** | `undo`, `redo` |
| **Output** | `export_fab`, `export_step`, `screenshot` |

## Electrical checks

DRC asks whether the fab can make the board. The electrical checks ask whether
the circuit is right. Flamingo has no schematic step, so they read the netlist
directly, with pin names from each part's EasyEDA symbol (`footprint.pins`, or
the parts cache for parts placed before footprints carried them) and pin roles
from a cited table in `packages/engine/src/erc/part-facts.ts`.

`run_erc` (and **Run ERC** in the editor) reports:

| Rule | Level | What |
|---|---|---|
| `power-pins` | error | IC supply or ground pin unconnected, or on the wrong kind of net |
| `single-pin-net` | warn | a net with one pin |
| `unconnected-ic-pin` | warn / info | IC or connector pad on no net; warn when the pin's role is unknown |
| `floating-input` | error / warn | a logic input nothing drives or pulls; warn when it is driven only through a connector |
| `decoupling` | warn | supply pin with no capacitor to ground, or the nearest more than 10 mm away |
| `polarity` | error / warn | an LED that can never light, a diode shorting a rail, a part note that contradicts the symbol's pad 1 |
| `esp32` | error / warn | ESP32-S3 strapping pins, EN reset delay, octal-PSRAM GPIO |
| `usb-cc` | error / warn | USB-C CC pins without 5.1k pull-downs |

Findings are data (`error`, `warn`, `info`). Errors gate `export_fab` like DRC
violations. A deliberate exception goes in the board's `checkWaivers`, with a
reason: `{ "rule": "unconnected-ic-pin", "items": ["J6.9"], "reason": "MISO left open on purpose" }`.

`flamingo check` runs the checks headless, for CI and before ordering:

```bash
flamingo check board.flamingo [more ...] [--json] [--quiet] [--only drc,erc] [--stock]
flamingo check combo.plamingo          # every board on the panel, then the panel checks
```

It prints one line per finding and the board file's sha256, and exits 0 when
clean, 1 on any error finding, 2 when the tool itself failed. The JLCPCB stock
check needs the network, so it only runs with `--stock`. Checks are a registry
(`packages/server/src/checks.ts`): a board check is
`{ name, description, run(board, ctx) }` and a panel check
`{ name, description, run(panel, boards, ctx) }`, both returning findings.

## Panels and order cost

Several boards, of the same or of different designs, can be fabricated and
assembled as one **panel**. Flamingo lays the panel out, checks it against
JLCPCB's limits, estimates what it costs against the alternatives, and exports
one fileset for the whole panel.

```bash
node packages/server/dist/cli.js serve combo.plamingo    # prints "Flamingo v0.1.0 serving …"
```

A panel file is served the way a board file is: one file, one server, its view
at `http://localhost:4242` (`FLAMINGO_PORT` to change the port), the file
created if it is missing. The server has the 23 panel tools at `/mcp` and no
board tools; boards are edited in servers of their own, and the panel notices
when one of its boards changes on disk.

To have the board tools and the panel tools at one MCP endpoint, serve a board
and name the panel. The panel view is then at `/panel`:

```bash
node packages/server/dist/cli.js serve board.flamingo --panel combo.plamingo
```

A panel is a `.plamingo` file stored next to the boards. It refers to each
source board by relative path plus a content hash and never copies it, so a
board edited after it was added marks the panel **stale** until
`panel_refresh_boards` accepts the change. Every edit is an operation with
undo/redo, as for boards.

```
boards + quantities → quote_order → panel_apply_scenario → panel_check → export_panel_fab
```

### Panel MCP tools

23 tools, served at the same `/mcp` endpoint as the 35 board tools:

| Group | Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **File** | `panel_new` | Create an empty panel and save it as `<name>.plamingo`. |
| | `panel_open` | Open a panel file. |
| | `panel_save` | Save now (edits also autosave). |
| | `panel_get_state` | Text summary: size, settings, boards and quantities, every instance, check and cost totals. |
| **Boards** | `panel_add_board` | Add a board file as a source, with a short key (`S`, `M`) and its quantities. |
| | `panel_remove_board` | Remove a board and all of its instances. |
| | `panel_refresh_boards` | Accept source boards as they are on disk now; clears `stale`. |
| | `panel_set_quantity` | Set `needed` (assembled boards you must get) and `niceToHave` (total boards welcome if cheap). |
| **Instances** | `panel_add_instance` | Put one more copy of a board on the panel. |
| | `panel_remove_instance` | Remove one instance. |
| | `panel_move_instance` | Move an instance; pins it unless `pin:false`. |
| | `panel_rotate_instance` | Rotate in steps of 90° about the instance's centre. |
| | `panel_set_populate` | `true` = assemble; `false` = ship bare (all its parts become do-not-place). |
| | `panel_pin` | Pin or unpin. Pinned instances are never moved by arrange. |
| **Layout** | `panel_set_settings` | Separation, spacing, rails, tabs, fiducials, tooling holes, layer count (promotion). |
| | `panel_arrange` | Pack every unpinned instance into the smallest panel that fits the limits. |
| | `panel_check` | Report everything wrong with the panel, as data. |
| | `panel_screenshot` | Render the panel to a PNG. |
| **History** | `panel_undo`, `panel_redo` | Walk the panel's op log. |
| **Cost** | `quote_order` | Ranked order scenarios with itemized fees, plus the cost of the panel as it stands. |
| | `panel_apply_scenario` | Load the panel a scenario implies onto the panel. |
| **Output** | `export_panel_fab` | Write `gerbers.zip`, merged `bom.csv` and `cpl.csv`, and `panel.render.svg`. |

Instances are named after their board: `S1`, `M1`, `M2`, ... In the merged BOM
and CPL every designator is prefixed with its instance (`S1_U2`, `M3_R5`) and
every position is in panel coordinates. Positions are the bottom-left corner of
the instance's bounding box, in mm, y-up, like everything else in Flamingo.

### What the check looks for

- **Source boards**: unreadable, stale, or with DRC violations of their own.
- **Stackup**: all boards on a panel must share a layer count and rules set. A
  mismatch is reported with the option to **promote** the panel
  (`panel_set_settings copperLayers=4`): boards with fewer layers are then made
  at the higher count.
- **Blocked edges**: an edge where a component courtyard overhangs the outline
  (a USB-C connector) or a keepout reaches the edge (an antenna region) carries
  no tabs and keeps extra clearance from its neighbour.
- **Placement**: overlaps, spacing, overhanging parts that would hit a
  neighbour or a rail, instances that nothing holds.
- **Size**: the fab's largest board and the assembly services' panel limits.

Errors stop `export_panel_fab` unless `waive:true`. Limits and panel geometry
defaults live in `packages/panel/config/panel-limits.json`.

### Cost model

`quote_order` compares, from each design's `needed` and `niceToHave`:

- separate orders, one per design
- each design on a panel of its own
- one merged mouse-bite panel (pays JLCPCB's different-designs fee)
- one board with the designs divided by silkscreen lines (counts as one design;
  you cut the boards apart yourself)
- different panel counts and quantity steps
- nice-to-have boards populated, or shipped bare (partial population)
- for boards with different layer counts: split into one order per layer
  count, or promote

Rank by `total` (default), `per-board` or `overage`.

Fees live in `packages/panel/config/fee-table.json`. Each value records its
source URL and whether it was verified on a JLCPCB help page. **Anything built
on an unverified value is an estimate** and is marked `~` in every report and
in the browser. Assembly fees are verified; bare-board prices are estimates,
because JLCPCB publishes them only through its quote calculator, which
Flamingo never calls. Shipping, tax and coupons are not included. Nothing is
ever sent to JLCPCB and nothing is ordered.

Set `FLAMINGO_PANEL_CONFIG_DIR` to use your own copies of the two config files,
and `FLAMINGO_PANEL_PRICES=off` to skip part price lookups.

### Panel CLI

Every tool has a command that works on a panel file directly, no server needed:

```bash
flamingo panel new combo.plamingo --name combo
flamingo panel add-board combo.plamingo esp32.flamingo --key S --needed 1
flamingo panel add-board combo.plamingo breakout.flamingo --key M --needed 5
flamingo panel quote combo.plamingo
flamingo panel apply-scenario combo.plamingo merged-needed-x2
flamingo panel check combo.plamingo        # exit status 1 on errors
flamingo panel screenshot combo.plamingo --out combo.png
flamingo panel export combo.plamingo --out fab/combo
```

| Command | MCP tool |
| --- | --- |
| `new <file> [--name N]` | `panel_new` |
| `show <file>` | `panel_get_state` |
| `add-board <file> <board> [--key K] [--needed N] [--nice N]` | `panel_add_board` |
| `remove-board <file> <key>` | `panel_remove_board` |
| `refresh <file> [key ...]` | `panel_refresh_boards` |
| `set-quantity <file> <key> [--needed N] [--nice N]` | `panel_set_quantity` |
| `add-instance <file> <key> [--x X --y Y] [--rotation R] [--bare] [--count N]` | `panel_add_instance` |
| `remove-instance <file> <id>` | `panel_remove_instance` |
| `move-instance <file> <id> --x X --y Y [--no-pin]` | `panel_move_instance` |
| `rotate-instance <file> <id> [--rotation R \| --by DEG]` | `panel_rotate_instance` |
| `set-populate <file> <id> <true\|false>` | `panel_set_populate` |
| `pin <file> <id> [--unpin]` | `panel_pin` |
| `set <file> [--separation S] [--spacing MM] [--rail-top MM] ... [--layers auto\|2\|4\|6]` | `panel_set_settings` |
| `arrange <file> [--no-rotate]` | `panel_arrange` |
| `check <file>` | `panel_check` |
| `screenshot <file> [--out F] [--width PX]` | `panel_screenshot` |
| `quote <file> [--objective O] [--brief] [--json] [--offline]` | `quote_order` |
| `apply-scenario <file> <id>` | `panel_apply_scenario` |
| `export <file> [--out DIR] [--waive]` | `export_panel_fab` |

`panel_undo` and `panel_redo` have no command: the op log is kept in memory, as
it is for boards, and each command is a process of its own.

### Panel view

The page of a panel server (`/`, or `/panel` on a board server) is a
slicer-style view: the panel as the build plate, board instances as objects you
select, drag, rotate and duplicate. The sidebar is three steps: the boards you
need and how many; the ways to order them, cheapest first, the panel on the
plate among them; and what is on the plate, with its counts, **Arrange** (`A`),
cost, checks and export. It shares the panel with MCP: an edit made through
either shows up in the other at once.

A panel is started from the page: **Boards** lists the board files next to the
panel, and picking one puts it on the plate. Each design has its own colour, on
the plate and in every list. Colour means which board and nothing else; bare,
pinned, blocked and in-error are drawn with line style, hatching and labels.

## Architecture

npm workspaces monorepo — all packages are ESM, strict TypeScript, tested with
Vitest (`packages/*/test/*.test.ts`):

```
packages/
  engine/   pure library: data model, geometry, netlist/ratsnest, zone fill, DRC, ops
  parts/    LCSC search + EasyEDA footprint fetch/parse/cache
  fab/      Gerber X2 + Excellon writers, BOM/CPL writers, DSN export / SES import
  panel/    panel format + ops, constraint checks, arrange, merge to one board, cost model, scenarios
  server/   Node: document host, op-log + undo/redo, HTTP + WebSocket, MCP endpoint, CLI, autoroute runner
  ui/       browser PCB view (Canvas 2D) with mouse editing tools
```

The `server` is the hub: it owns the live `Doc` (board + undo/redo), serves the
`ui` at `/`, streams changes over `/ws`, and exposes every editing operation as
an MCP tool at `/mcp`. Claude Code and the browser both act on the same board.

## Development

```bash
npm run build   # tsc -p . in every package (+ vite build for the ui)
npm test        # vitest run in every package
```

The full prompt→fab pipeline is exercised for real (live LCSC parts, real
Freerouting) by:

```bash
npx tsx packages/server/scripts/e2e-esp32.ts
```

which builds the reference board above, asserts a DRC-clean export, and
tracespace-validates every Gerber.
